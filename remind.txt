variables -> storing data for later retrieval
eg: var, let, const
          -> naming variables -> snake_case
                              -> camelCase
Data types -> strings -> when it is enclosedin a single quote or double quote
                      ->var person = "Nick"
           ->numbers
           -> null ->
           ->undefined             

    -> accessing values -> key.value
comparison operators -> greater than (>)
                     -> less than (<)
                     -> equal to (==)
                     -> strictly equal to (===)
                     -> not equal to (!=)
